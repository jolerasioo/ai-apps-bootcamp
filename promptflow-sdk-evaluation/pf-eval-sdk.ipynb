Given either a test dataset or a target, your generative AI application generations are quantitatively measured with both mathematical based metrics and AI-assisted quality and safety evaluators. Built-in or custom evaluators can provide you with comprehensive insights into the application's capabilities and limitations.\n","\n","In this notebook, you will learn how to run evaluators on a
